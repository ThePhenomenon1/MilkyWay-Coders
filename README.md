# MilkyWay-Coders
Coders must unite against intergalactic invasion

Yes Sirree, only coders can protect the round blue marble now.
Someone produced a movie called "Aliens in Your Hood." 
A freakish arrangement of solar wind transported this movie's signals to an exoplanet called Lataf Rorre.
Mightily displeased with the onscreen depictions of extraterrestrials, the natives on Lataf Rorre shall be landing shortly to exact their pound of flesh.

Only the greatest humans, that is the brave, the morally upright, the noble coders can be entrusted to deal with this emergency. 
Two honourable tribes have been assembled, the valorous NOHTYPs and the glorious AVAJs.

More info to be released shortly.
