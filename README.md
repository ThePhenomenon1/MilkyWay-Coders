# MilkyWay-Coders
Coders must unite against intergalactic invasion

Yes Sirree, only coders can protect the round blue marble now.
A meatbag on our planet produced a movie called "Aliens in Your Hood." 
Then a freakish arrangement of solar wind transported this movie's signals to an exoplanet called Lataf Rorre.
Mightily displeased with the onscreen depictions of extraterrestrials, the brooding natives on Lataf Rorre shall be landing shortly in our Solar System to exact their pound of flesh.

Earth must do all it can to prepare. Only the greatest humans, that is the brave, the morally upright, the noble coders can be entrusted to deal with this emergency. 
Two honourable tribes have been assembled, the valorous NOHTYPs and the glorious AVAJs.

What role shall Generalissimo Machine and his minions play? More info to be released in the Django Web application I shall be deploying on Heroku.
